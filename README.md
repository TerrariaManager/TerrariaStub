# TerrariaStub
A Terraria stub app for AVDs.

## Why?
Terraria for Android is not compiled/released for x86 and the only AVDs that support Google Play Store are x86 AVD system images. Since Terraria also requires the Playstore for purchase verification and there not being an AVD that supports ARM or ARM64 that comes with Google Play Services, Terraria cannot be used on any AVD.
